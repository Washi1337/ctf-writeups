Oh. (to Andy) Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? It folds out. Ken holds up his brochure, with photos of himself, and a resume in the middle. ANGLE ON: Barry hiding behind the curtains, as Ken CLOSES THE WINDOW. Bee Movie - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 30. BARRY Oh no, more humans. I don‚Äôt need this. Barry HOVERS up into the air and THROWS himself into the glass. BARRY (CONT‚ÄôD) (dazed) Ow! What was that? He does it again, and then multiple more times. BARRY (CONT'D) Maybe this time...this time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time. Barry JUMPS onto the drapes. BARRY (CONT'D) (out of breath) Drapes! (then, re: glass) That is diabolical. KEN It‚Äôs fantastic. It‚Äôs got all my special skills, even my top ten favorite movies. ANDY What‚Äôs your number one? Star Wars? KEN Ah, I don‚Äôt go for that, (makes Star Wars noises), kind of stuff. ANGLE ON: Barry. BARRY No wonder we‚Äôre not supposed to talk to them. They‚Äôre out of their minds. KEN When I walk out of a job interview they‚Äôre flabbergasted. They can‚Äôt believe the things I say. Barry looks around and sees the LIGHT BULB FIXTURE in the middle of the ceiling. Bee Movie - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 31. BARRY (re: light bulb) Oh, there‚Äôs the sun. Maybe that‚Äôs a way out. Barry takes off and heads straight for the light bulb. His POV: The seventy-five watt label grows as he gets closer. BARRY (CONT‚ÄôD) I don‚Äôt remember the sun having a big seventy five on it. Barry HITS the bulb and is KNOCKED SILLY. He falls into a BOWL OF GUACAMOLE. Andy dips his chip in the guacamole, taking Barry with it. ANGLE ON: Ken and Andy. KEN I‚Äôll tell you what. You know what? I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Barry‚Äôs POV: Giant human mouth opening. KEN (CONT‚ÄôD) Wait! Stop! Beeeeeee! ANNA Kill it! Kill it! They all JUMP up from their chairs. Andy looks around for something to use. Ken comes in for the kill with a big TIMBERLAND BOOT on each hand. KEN Stand back. These are winter boots. Vanessa ENTERS, and stops Ken from squashing Barry. VANESSA (grabs Ken‚Äôs arm) Wait. Don‚Äôt kill him. CLOSE UP: on Barry‚Äôs puzzled face. KEN You know I‚Äôm allergic to them. This thing could kill me. Bee Movie - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 32. VANESSA Why does his life have any less value than yours? She takes a GLASS TUMBLER and places it over Barry. KEN Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? VANESSA I‚Äôm just saying, all life has value. You don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs capable of feeling. Barry looks up through the glass and watches this conversation, astounded.
