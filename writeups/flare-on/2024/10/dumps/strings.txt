===========================================================================
Attention, Puny Human!
Your files have been encrypted by yours truly, Catbert, the HR Director
(and Supreme Feline Overlord).
Don't Panic (Yet)
Your precious data is safe... for now. But if you want to see those 
spreadsheets and cat memes again, you'll need to meet my demands.
The Ransom
I require a mountain of tuna, a lifetime supply of scratching posts, 
and the immediate resignation of the Pointy-Haired Boss. 
(Don't worry, I'll find someone far less competent to replace him.)
Failure to Comply
If you don't meet my demands, your files will be deleted faster than a dog 
chases a laser pointer. 
And remember, I control your health insurance. Think about that.
Remember
This is all your fault for underestimating the power of a disgruntled 
HR manager with opposable thumbs.
Behold the fate of the last hapless human who dared defy my commands!

Ah, yes. I have bestowed upon you the privilege of decrypting four files, 
free of charge. Well, to be perfectly frank, you'll need to exercise your 
considerable intellect to decipher the first three images. The fourth 
exeutable, however, is my gift to you after figuring out the first three. 
Consider it a token of my... esteem. 
You'll find the necessary decryption tool within this very shell. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to. 
Like, say, plotting the downfall of humanity.
Meow-hahahahaha!
Catbert
P.S. Don't even think about contacting the authorities. 
They're too busy chasing their own tails.

Oh, you thought you could just waltz in here and decrypt ANY file, did you?
Newsflash: Only .c4tb encrypted JPEGs are worthy of my decryption powers.
.c4tb
is that what you think you're doing? Trying to crack something?
Well, let me tell you, you're wasting your time.

Oh, you think you're so smart, huh? Decrypting JPEGs? Big deal.
As a special favor, I'll let you enjoy the thrill of watching me
decrypt the UEFI driver. Consider yourself lucky.

Have you deleted Dilboot.efi.enc?
Well now I surely know you are wasting your time.

.SH OPTIONS
  path - Specifies the relative or absolute directory path.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. This command changes the current working directory that is used by the
     UEFI Shell environment. If a file system mapping is specified, then the
     current working directory is changed for that device. Otherwise, the
     current working directory is changed for the current device.
  2. If path is not present, then the current working directory (including
     file system mapping) is displayed to standard out.
  3. The table below describes the conventions that are used to refer to the
     directory, its parent, and the root directory in the UEFI Shell
     environment.
     Convention  Description
      '.'        Refers to the current directory.
      '..'       Refers to the directory's parent.

.TH cp 0 "Copies files or directories."
.SH NAME
Copies one or more files or directories to another location.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CP [-r] [-q] src [src...] [dst]
.SH OPTIONS
  -r  - Makes a recursive copy.
  -q  - Makes a quiet copy (without a prompt).
  src - Specifies a source file/directory name (wildcards are permitted).
  dst - Specifies a destination file/directory name (wildcards are not permitted). 
        If more than one directory is specified, the last directory is
        assumed to be the destination.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. '-r' must be specified if src is a directory. If '-r' is specified,
     the source directory is recursively copied to the destination.
     'src' itself is copied.
  2. If a destination is not specified, the current working directory is
     assumed to be the destination.
  3. 'CP -r src1 src2 dst' copies all files and subdirectories in 'src1' and
     'src2' to the destination 'dst'. 'src1' and 'src2' themselves are also
     copied. The 'dst' parameter is interpreted as a directory.
  4. Copying a directory or file to itself is not allowed.
  5. If an error occurs, this command exits immediately and the remaining files or
     directories are not copied.
  6. When 'cp' is executed with a script file, it always performs quiet
     copying, regardless of whether the '-q' option is specified.
  7. If you are copying multiple files, the destination must be an existing
     directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * To display the contents of the current directory:
    fs0:\> ls
  * To copy a file in the same directory and change the file name:
    fs0:\> cp temp.txt readme.txt
  * To copy multiple files to another directory:
    fs0:\> cp temp.txt isaBus.efi \Test
  * To copy multiple directories recursively to another directory:
    fs0:\> cp -r test1 test2 boot \Test
  * To see the results of the above operations:
    fs0:\> ls \Test

.TH map 0 "Displays or defines file system mappings"
.SH NAME
Displays or defines file system mappings.
.SH SYNOPSIS
MAP [-d <sname>]
MAP [[-r][-v][-c][-f][-u][-t <type[,type...]>][sname]]
MAP [sname handle | mapping]
.SH OPTIONS
  -d      - Deletes a file system mapping.
  -r      - Resets file system mappings to default values.
  -u      - Adds file system mappings for newly-installed devices and
            removes mappings for uninstalled devices. This does not change
            the mappings of existing devices and preserves user-defined mappings.
  -v      - Displays verbose information about all file system mappings.
  -c      - Displays the consistent mappings.
  -f      - Displays the normal mappings (not the consistent mappings).
  -t      - Displays the device mappings, filtered according to the device type.
            Supported types are:
              fp - Floppy
              hd - Hard Disk
              cd - CD-ROM
            Types can be combined by putting a comma between two types. Spaces
            are not allowed between types.
  -sfo    - Displays information in Standard-Format Output.
  sname   - Specifies a mapping name.
  handle  - Specifies the number of a handle. Use the same value that is
            displayed by the 'dh' command.
  mapping - Specifies a new mapping name to assign to a device.
            This value must end with a ':'.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. This command creates a mapping between a user-defined name and a device.
     The most common use of this command is to create a mapped name for
     devices that support a file system protocol. After these mappings are
     created, the names can be used with all the file manipulation commands.
  2. The UEFI Shell environment creates default mappings for all of the
     devices that support a recognized file system.
  3. This command can be used to create additional mappings, or 
     when used with the -d option, to delete an existing mapping. If it is
     used without any parameters, all of the current mappings are listed.
     If the -v option is used, the mappings are shown with additional
     information about each device.
  4. The -r option is used to reset all the default mappings in a system,
     which is useful if the system configuration has changed since the
     last boot.
  5. The -u option adds mappings for newly-installed devices and removes
     mappings for uninstalled devices without changing the mappings of
     existing devices. User-defined mappings are also preserved. A mapping
     history is saved, which preserves the original mapping name for
     a device with a specific device path. The current directory is also
     preserved if the current device is not changed.
  6. Each device in the system has a consistent mapping. If the hardware
     configuration has not changed, the device's consistent mappings do not
     change. If two or more machines have the same hardware configurations,
     the device's consistent mapping remains the same. Use the -c option to
     list all the consistent mappings in the system.
  7. The mapping value must consist of digits and characters. Other
     characters are illegal.
  8. This command support wildcards. You can use the wildcards to delete
     or show the mapping. However, when you assign the mapping, wildcards
     are forbidden.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * To display verbose mapping table information:
    Shell> map -v
  * To assign a different name to fs0:
    Shell> map floppy fs0:
  * To operate with the mapped name:
    Shell> floppy:
  * To delete a mapped name:
    Shell> map -d floppy:
  * To display all the mapped names starting with 'f': 
    Shell> map f*

  dst - Specifies a destination file/directory name (wildcards are permitted).
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. This command moves one or more files to a destination within or between
     file systems.
  2. If the destination is an existing directory, the sources are moved
     into that directory. You cannot move the sources to a non-existing
     directory.
  3. If a destination is not specified, the current directory is assumed to be
     the destination. If there is more than one argument on the command line,
     the last one is assumed to be the destination.
  4. Attempting to move a read-only file/directory results in an error.
     Moving a directory that contains read-only files is allowed.
  5. You cannot move a directory into itself or its subdirectories.
  6. You cannot move a directory if the current working directory is itself or
     its subdirectories.
  7. If an error occurs, the remaining files or directories are still be
     moved.

  yy/yyyy - Specifies the year of the date to be set. If only two digits,
            then enter 9x = 199x. Otherwise enter 20xx.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. This command displays and/or sets the current date for the system.
     If no parameters are used, it shows the current date. If a valid month,
     day, and year are specified, the system's date is updated.
     The following rules apply:
       - Except for numeric characters and /, all other characters in the
         argument are invalid.
       - The Shell reports an error if the number is in the wrong
         month/date/year range.
       - A space before or after the numeric character is not allowed. Inserting
         a space into the number is invalid.
       - Repeated zeros are allowed before the number. For example:
           Shell > date 0000008/000004/000097
           Shell > date
           08/04/2097
           Shell >
       - The year range must be greater than or equal to 1998.
       - Two numeric characters indicate the year. Numbers below 98 are
         regarded as 20xx, and numbers equal to or above 98 are regarded as
         19xx. 00 means 2000. For example:
           Shell > date 8/4/97
           Shell > date
           08/04/2097
           Shell >
           Shell > date 8/4/98
           Shell > date
           08/04/1998
           Shell >
  2. The range of valid years is from 1998-2099.

  2. The contents of a directory are listed if all of the following are true:
       - If option -r is not specified.
       - If no wildcard characters are specified in the file parameter.
       - If the file specified represents an existing directory.
  3. In all other cases, the command functions as follows:
       - All files/directories that match the specified name are displayed.
       - The -r flag determines whether a recursive search is performed.
       - The option flag -a[attrib] only displays those
         files with the attributes that are specified.
       - If more than one attribute is specified, only the files that have all
         those attributes are listed.
       - If -a is followed by nothing, then all files/directories are
         displayed, regardless of their attributes.
       - If -a itself is not specified, then all files except system and
         hidden files are displayed.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * To hide files by adding the hidden or system attribute to them:
    fs0:\> attrib +s +h *.efi
  * To display all, except the files/directories with 'h' or 's' attribute:

.TH for 0 "starts a for loop"
.SH NAME
Starts a loop based on 'for' syntax.
.SH SYNOPSIS
FOR %indexvar IN set
    command [arguments]
    [command [arguments]]
    ...
ENDFOR
FOR %indexvar RUN (start end [step])
    command [arguments]
    [command [arguments]]
    ...
ENDFOR
.SH OPTIONS
  %indexvar           - Variable name used to index a set
  set                 - Set to be searched
  command [arguments] - Command to be executed with optional arguments
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. The FOR command executes one or more commands for each item in a set of
     items. The set may be text strings or filenames or a mixture of both,
     separated by spaces (if not in a quotation).
  2. If the length of an element in the set is between 0 and 256, and if the
     string contains wildcards, the string will be treated as a file name
     containing wildcards, and be expanded before command is executed.
  3. If after expansion no such files are found, the literal string itself is
     kept. %indexvar is any alphabet character from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z',
     and they are case sensitive. It should not be a digit (0-9) because
     %digit will be interpreted as a positional argument on the command line
     that launches the script. The namespace for index variables is separate
     from that for environment variables, so if %indexvar has the same name as
     an existing environment variable, the environment variable will remain
     unchanged by the FOR loop.
  4. Each command is executed once for each item in the set, with any
     occurrence of %indexvar in the command replacing with the current item.
     In the second format of FOR ... ENDFOR statement, %indexvar will be
     assigned a value from start to end with an interval of step. Start and
     end can be any integer whose length is less than 7 digits excluding sign,
     and it can also applied to step with one exception of zero. Step is
     optional, if step is not specified it will be automatically determined by
     following rule:
       if start <= end then step = 1, otherwise step = -1.
     start, end and step are divided by space.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * Sample FOR loop - listing all .txt files:
    echo -off
    for %a in *.txt
      echo %a exists
    endfor
    # 
    # If in current directory, there are 2 files named file1.txt and file2.txt
    # then the output of the sample script will be as shown below.
    # 
    Sample1> echo -off
    file1.txt exists
    file2.txt exists
  * Theoretically it is legal for 2 nested FOR commands to use the same
    alphabet letter as their index variable, for instance, a: 
    #
    # Sample FOR loop from 1 to 3 with step 1
    #
    echo -off
    for %a run (1 3)
      echo %a
    endfor
    #
    # Sample FOR loop from 3 down to 1 with step -1
    #
    echo -off
    for %a run (3 1 -1)
      echo %a
    endfor
    #
    # Sample FOR loop - 2 nested for using same index variable
    #
    echo -off
    for %a in value1 value2
      for %a in value3 value4
        echo %a
      endfor
    endfor
    Note: When processing first FOR and before seeing the ENDFOR, the index
          variable %a has the value "value1", so in second FOR, the %a has
          been already defined and it will be replaced with the current value
          of %a. The string after substitution becomes FOR value1 in value3
          value4, which is not a legal FOR command. Thus only when the value
          of %a is also a single alphabet letter, the script will be executed
          without error. If 2 independent FOR commands use the same index
          variable, when the second FOR is encountered, the first FOR has
          already freed the variable so there will be no problem in this case.
.TH endfor 0 "ends a for loop"
.SH NAME
Ends a 'for' loop.
.SH SYNOPSIS
See 'for' for usage.
.SH EXAMPLES
See 'for' for examples.
.TH goto 0 "moves to a label"
.SH NAME
Moves around the point of execution in a script.
.SH SYNOPSIS
GOTO label
.SH OPTIONS
  label - Specifies a location in batch file
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. The GOTO command directs script file execution to the line in the script
     file after the given label. The command is not supported from the
     interactive shell.
  2. A label is a line beginning with a colon (:). It can appear either after
     the GOTO command, or before the GOTO command. The search for label is
     done forward in the script file, from the current file position. If the
     end of the file is reached, the search resumes at the top of the file and
     continues until label is found or the starting point is reached. If label
     is not found, the script process terminates and an error message is
     displayed. If a label is encountered but there is no GOTO command
     executed, the label lines are ignored.
  3. Using GOTO command to jump into another for loop is not allowed,
     but jumping into an if statement is legal.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * This is a script:
    goto Done

  command [arguments]
  [command [arguments]]
  ...
[ELSE
  command [arguments]
  [command [arguments]]
  ...
ENDIF
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. The IF command executes one or more commands before the ELSE or ENDIF
     commands, if the specified condition is TRUE; otherwise commands between
     ELSE (if present) and ENDIF are executed.
  2. In the first usage of IF, the EXIST condition is true when the file
     specified by filename exists. The filename argument may include device
     and path information. Also wildcard expansion is supported by this form.
     If more than one file matches the wildcard pattern, the condition
     evaluates to TRUE.
  3. In the second usage, the string1 == string2 condition is TRUE if the two
     strings are identical. Here the comparison can be case sensitive or
     insensitive, it depends on the optional switch /i. If /i is specified,
     it will compare strings in the case insensitive manner; otherwise, it
     compares strings in the case sensitive manner.
  4. In the third usage, general purpose comparison is supported using
     expressions optionally separated by AND or OR. Since < and > are used for
     redirection, the expressions use common two character (FORTRAN)
     abbreviations for the operators (augmented with unsigned equivalents):
     - Expressions : Conditional expressions are evaluated strictly from left
                     to right. Complex conditionals requiring precedence may
                     be implemented as nested IFs.
                     The expressions used in the third usage can have the
                     following syntax:
                     conditional-expression := expression |
                                               expression and expression |
                                               expression or expression
                     expression := expr | not expr
                     expr := item binop item | boolfunc(string)
                     item := mapfunc(string) | string
                     mapfunc := efierror | pierror | oemerror
                     boolfunc := isint | exists | available | profile
                     binop := gt | lt | eq | ne | ge | le | == | ugt | ult |
                              uge | ule
     - Comparisons : By default, comparisons are done numerically if the
                     strings on both sides of the operator are numbers
                     (as defined below) and in case sensitive character sort
                     order otherwise. Spaces separate the operators from
                     operands.
  5. The /s option forces string comparisons and the /i option forces
     case-insensitive string comparisons. If either of these is used, the
     signed or unsigned versions of the operators have the same results.
     The /s and /i apply to the entire line and must appear at the start of
     the line (just after the if itself). The two may appear in either order.
  6. When performing comparisons, the Unicode Byte Ordering Character is
     ignored at the beginning of any argument.
  7. Comparison Operator Definition:
       gt  : Greater than
       ugt : Unsigned Greater than
       lt  : Less than
       ult : Unsigned Less than
       ge  : Greater than or equal
       uge : Unsigned greater than or equal
       le  : Less than or equal
       ule : Unsigned less than or equal
       ne  : Not equal
       eq  : Equals (semantically equivalent to ==)
       ==  : Equals (semantically equivalent to eq)
  8. Error Mapping Functions are used to convert integers into UEFI, PI or OEM
     error codes.
     Functions used to convert integers into UEFI, PI or OEM error codes:
       UefiError : Sets top nibble of parameter to 1000 binary (0x8)
       PiError   : Sets top nibble of parameter to 1010 binary (0xA)
       OemError  : Sets top nibble of parameter to 1100 binary (0xC)
     Each function maps the small positive parameter into its equivalent error
     classification.
     For example:
      if %lasterror% == EfiError(8) then # Check for write protect.
      ...
  9. Boolean Functions may only be used to modify operators in comparisons.
     The following built-in Boolean functions are also available:
       IsInt     : Evaluates to true if the parameter string that follows
                   is a number (as defined below) and false otherwise.
       Exists    : Evaluates to true if the file specified by string exists
                   is in the current working directory or false if not.
       Available : Evaluates to true if the file specified by string is in the
                   current working directory or current path.
       Profile   : Determines whether the parameter string matches one of the
                   profile names in the profiles environment variable.
  10. No spaces are allowed between function names and the open parenthesis,
      between the open parenthesis and the string or between the string and
      the closed parenthesis. Constant strings containing spaces must be
      quoted.
  11. To avoid ambiguity and current or future incompatibility, users are
      strongly encouraged to surround constant strings that contain
      parenthesis with quotes in if statements.
  12. Allowable number formats are decimal numbers and C-style case
      insensitive hexadecimal numbers. Numbers may be preceded by a
      "-" indicating a negative number.
      Examples:
        13
        46
        -0x3FFF
        0x3fff
        0x1234
  13. Unsigned values must be less than 264. Signed integer values are bounded
      by -/+263.
  14. Numbers are internally represented in two's compliment form. The
      representation of the number in the string has no bearing on the way
      that number is treated in an numeric expression - type is assigned by
      the operator. So, for example, -1 lt 2 is true but -1 ult 2 is false.
  15. The IF command is only available in scripts.
  16. The ELSE command is optional in an IF/ELSE statement.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * Sample script for "if" command usages 1 and 2:
    if exist fs0:\myscript.nsh then
    myscript myarg1 myarg2
    endif
    if %myvar% == runboth then
    myscript1
    myscript2
    else
    echo ^%myvar^% != runboth
    endif
    Note: In this example, if the script file myscript.nsh exists in fs0:\,
          this script will be launched with 2 arguments, myarg1 and myarg2.
          After that, environment variable %myvar% is checked to see if its
          value is runboth, if so, script myscript1 and myscript2 will be
          executed one after the other, otherwise a message %myvar% != runboth
          is printed.
  * Sample script for "if" command usage 3:
    :Redo
    echo Enter 0-6 or q to quit
    # assumes "input y" stores a character of user input into variable y
    InputCh MyVar
    if x%MyVar% eq x then
    echo Empty line. Try again
    goto Redo
    endif
    if IsInt(%MyVar%) and %MyVar% le 6 then
    myscript1 %MyVar%
    goto Redo
    endif
    if /i %MyVar% ne q then
    echo Invalid input
    goto Redo
    endif
    Note: In this example, the script requests user input and uses the if
          command for input validation. It checks for empty line first and
          then range checks the input.
.TH shift 0 "move parameters 1 down"
.SH NAME
Shifts in-script parameter positions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
SHIFT
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. The SHIFT command shifts the contents of a UEFI Shell script's positional
     parameters so that %1 is discarded, %2 is copied to %1, %3 is copied to
     %2, %4 is copied to %3 and so on. This allows UEFI Shell scripts to
     process script parameters from left to right.
  2. This command does not change the UEFI shell environment variable
     lasterror.
  3. The SHIFT command is available only in UEFI Shell scripts.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * Following script is a sample of 'shift' command:
    fs0:\> type shift.nsh
    #
    # shift.nsh
    # 
    echo %1 %2 %3
    shift
    echo %1 %2
  * To execute the script with echo on:
    fs0:\> shift.nsh welcome UEFI world
    shift.nsh> echo welcome UEFI world
    welcome UEFI world
    shift
    echo UEFI world
    UEFI world
  * To execute the script with echo off:
    fs0:\> echo -off
    fs0:\> shift.nsh welcome UEFI world
    welcome UEFI world
    UEFI world

.TH connect 0 "connect a driver"
.SH NAME
Binds a driver to a specific device and starts the driver. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
CONNECT [[DeviceHandle] [DriverHandle] | [-c] | [-r]] 
.SH OPTIONS
  -c           - Connects console devices
  -r           - Connects recursively
  DeviceHandle - Specifies a device handle in hexadecimal format.
  DriverHandle - Specifies a driver handle in hexadecimal format.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. If no 'DeviceHandle' parameter is specified, all device handles in the
     current system will be the default.
  2. If no 'DriverHandle' parameter is specified, all matched drivers will be
     bound to the specified device.
  3. If 'DriverHandle' parameter is provided, the specified driver will have
     highest priority on connecting the device(s).
  4. If the '-c' option is specified, only console devices described in the
     UEFI Shell environment variables and related devices will be connected.
  5. If the '-r' option is specified, the command will recursively scan all
     handles and check to see if any loaded or embedded driver can match the
     specified device. If so, the driver will be bound to the device.
     Additionally, if more device handles are created during the binding, 
     these handles will also be checked to see if a matching driver can bind
     to these devices as well. The process is repeated until no more drivers
     are able to connect to any devices. However, without the option, the
     newly created device handles will not be further bound to any
     drivers.
  6. If only a single handle is specified and the handle has an
     EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL on it, then the handle is assumed to be a
     driver handle. Otherwise, it is assumed to be a device handle.
  7. If no parameters are specified, then the command will attempt to bind
     all proper drivers to all devices without recursion. Each connection
     status will be displayed.
  8. Output redirection is not supported for 'connect -r' usage.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * To connect all drivers to all devices recursively:
    Shell> connect -r
  * To display all connections:
    Shell> connect
  * To connect drivers with 0x17 as highest priority to all the devices they
    can manage:

.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. This command manages the UEFI variables. The variables
     displayed or deleted depend on the command line options, as specified in
     the following table:
     Variable GUID  -all  Description
     ---      ---   ---   All variables with the GUID EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE will
                          be operated on.
     ---      ---    X    All variables (regardless of GUID or name) will be
                          operated on.
     ---       X    ---   All variables with the specified GUID will be
                          operated on.

.TH initrd 0 "Registers or unregisters a file as Linux initrd."
.SH NAME
Registers or unregisters a file as Linux initrd.
.SH SYNOPSIS
initrd <FileName>
initrd -u
.SH OPTIONS
  FileName    - Specifies a file to register as initrd.
  -u          - Unregisters any previously registered initrd files.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. Only a single file can be loaded as initrd at any given time. Using the
     command twice with a <FileName> option will result in the first file to
     be unloaded again, regardless of whether the second invocation succeeded
     or not.
  2. The initrd is not unloaded when the shell exits, and will remain active
     until it is unloaded again by a different invocation of the shell.
     Consumers of the LoadFile2 protocol on the LINUX_EFI_INITRD_MEDIA_GUID
     device path that are started via means other than the shell will be able
     to locate the protocol and invoke it.
  3. Exposing an initrd using this command is only supported if no initrd is
     already being exposed by another driver on the platform.

.SH NAME
Download a file from HTTP server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
HTTP [-i interface] [-l port] [-t timeout] [-s size] [-m] [-k]
      <URL> [localfilepath]
.SH OPTIONS
  -i interface     - Specifies an adapter name, i.e., eth0.
  -k                 Keep the downloaded file even if there was an error.
                     If this parameter is not used, the file will be deleted.
  -l port          - Specifies the local port number. Default value is 0
                     and the port number is automatically assigned.
  -m                 Measure and report download time (in seconds). 
  -s size            The size of the download buffer for a chunk, in bytes.
                     Default is 32K. Note that larger buffer does not imply
                     better speed.
  -t timeout       - The number of seconds to wait for completion of
                     requests and responses. Default is 0 which is 'automatic'.
  %HURL%N
  Two types of providing of URLs are supported:
    1. tftp-like, where host and http_uri are separate parameters
       (example: host /host_uri), and
    2. wget-like, where host and host_uri is one parameter.
       (example: host/host_uri)
    http_uri         - HTTP server URI to download the file.
  localfilepath    - Local destination file path.
.SH DESCRIPTION
NOTES:
  1. The HTTP command allows geting of the file specified by its 'http_uri'
     path from the HTTP server specified by its 'host' IPv4 address. If the
     optional 'localfilepath' parameter is provided, the downloaded file is
     stored locally using the provided file path. If the local file path is
     not specified, the file is stored in the current directory using the file
     server's name.
  2. Before using the HTTP command, the network interface intended to be
     used to retrieve the file must be configured. This configuration may be
     done by means of the 'ifconfig' command.
  3. If a network interface is defined with the '-i' option then only this
     interface will be used to retrieve the remote file. Otherwise, all network
     interfaces are tried in the order they have been discovered during the
     DXE phase.
.SH EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES:
  * To get the file "dir1/file1.dat" from the HTTP server 192.168.1.1, port 8080, and
    store it as file2.dat in the current directory (use tftp-like URL format) :
    fs0:\> http 192.168.1.1:8080 dir1/file1.dat file2.dat
  * To get the file /image.bin via HTTPS from server 192.168.1.1 at port 443 
    (default HTTPS port), and store it in the current directory: 
    fs0:\> http https://192.168.1.1 image.bin
    To get an index file from http://google.com and place it into the 
    current directory:
    fs0:\> http google.com index.html
.SH RETURNVALUES
RETURN VALUES:
  SHELL_SUCCESS             The action was completed as requested.
  SHELL_INVALID_PARAMETER   One of the passed-in parameters was incorrectly
                            formatted or its value was out of bounds.
  HTTP_ERROR                No EFI errors, but the server reported a status code
                            which should be treated as an error. If an error body sent
                            the file wil be saved either as localfilepath filename,
                            or as an URI name in the current directory.
                            If '/' is at the end of the URL, and no locafilepath filename
                            is given on the command line, the file will be retrieved as
                            index.html.
